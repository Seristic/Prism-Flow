# PrismFlow v1.3.0 Release Notes

**Release Date**: July 4, 2025  
**Version**: 1.3.0  
**Type**: Major Feature Release

## üéâ Major New Feature: Automatic Git Detection

### ü§ñ GitWatcher - Solve the External Push Problem

**The Problem**: Discord notifications were only sent when using PrismFlow extension commands. External Git pushes (made via GitHub Copilot, CLI, terminal, or other tools) didn't trigger Discord notifications, leaving teams unaware of important repository changes.

**The Solution**: Introducing **GitWatcher** - an intelligent monitoring system that automatically detects ALL Git operations and sends Discord notifications in real-time.

### ‚ú® Key Features

#### üì° **Real-time Monitoring**
- File system watchers monitor `.git/refs/**` and `.git/HEAD`
- Instant detection of commits, pushes, merges, and branch switches
- Works regardless of how the Git operation was performed

#### üîÑ **Comprehensive Coverage**
- **GitHub Copilot commits** ‚úÖ
- **Command line pushes** ‚úÖ
- **Terminal Git operations** ‚úÖ
- **VS Code Git panel actions** ‚úÖ
- **External Git tools** ‚úÖ

#### üè∑Ô∏è **Intelligent Release Detection**
- Automatically detects version tags (v1.2.3 pattern)
- Sends release notifications to configured Discord channels
- No manual intervention required

#### üõ°Ô∏è **Robust & Reliable**
- 30-second polling as fallback mechanism
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Automatic repository URL detection
- Smart commit information extraction

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### GitWatcher Class (`src/gitWatcher.ts`)
```typescript
export class GitWatcher {
  // Monitors Git repository changes in real-time
  // Automatically triggers Discord notifications
  // Handles both pushes and release tags
}
```

#### Integration Points
- Seamlessly integrates with existing Discord webhook system
- Respects user webhook configurations and event preferences
- Proper VS Code extension lifecycle management

### üß™ Testing & Validation

#### New Test Command
- **Command**: `PrismFlow: Test Git Watcher`
- **Purpose**: Manual testing and validation of GitWatcher functionality
- **Features**: Shows latest commit info and triggers test Discord notification

#### Automated Testing
- Real-time file system monitoring validation
- Commit detection accuracy testing
- Discord notification delivery confirmation

### üöÄ Benefits

#### For Development Teams
- **Complete Visibility**: Never miss a commit or release again
- **Team Coordination**: All team members stay informed of repository changes
- **DevOps Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Discord workflows

#### For Solo Developers
- **Cross-Platform Sync**: Git operations from any tool trigger notifications
- **Release Management**: Automatic release notifications for version tags
- **Workflow Automation**: Reduced manual Discord notification management
