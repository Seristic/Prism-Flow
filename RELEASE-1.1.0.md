## ðŸ“¦ Installation

## ðŸŽ‰ Why This Update?

This update solves the core issue where dashboard highlighting commands were unreliable due to VS Code's editor state management. By moving editor-specific features to the Command Palette (where they belong), we've achieved:

- **100% reliable dashboard commands**
- **No more infinite loops or focus issues**
- **Clearer user expectations**
- **Better separation of concerns**

The dashboard is now a clean, reliable management interface while the Command Palette handles editor-specific features with proper context awareness.
