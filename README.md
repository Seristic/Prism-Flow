# PrismFlow

_Navigate Your Code with Clarity and Flow. Keep your repositories clean effortlessly._

---

## ‚ú® Description

**PrismFlow** is an accessibility-focused VS Code extension designed to revolutionize how you understand and navigate your codebase, while ensuring your Git repositories remain clean and focused.

In the dynamic world of development, code can quickly become complex and daunting, and untracked files can clutter your workspace. PrismFlow steps in to illuminate your path and streamline your workflow.

This extension intelligently highlights logical code blocks (like functions, objects, loops, or custom sections) and displays concise, contextual information directly in the editor's whitespace for instant clarity.

Beyond navigation, PrismFlow also introduces powerful `.gitignore` automation. It intelligently detects common untracked files (like build outputs, temporary files, or dependency folders) and can automatically add them to your `.gitignore`, keeping your repositories tidy without manual intervention. **Additionally, PrismFlow helps you kickstart new files by automatically inserting a header comment with essential file details like language and path.**

Experience a more intuitive and inclusive way to explore your code, making complex structures clear, easy to follow, and your Git management effortless.

## üí° Usage

### Code Structure Navigation (Primary Feature)

Once activated, PrismFlow automatically analyzes your active editor to identify logical code blocks based on common programming language structures (e.g., `if` statements, `for` loops, function definitions, object literals).

- **Visual Highlights:** You'll see a subtle background highlight applied to these detected blocks.
- **Whitespace Labels:** Next to the opening line of a highlighted block, a small label containing its inferred name or purpose will appear in the margin, allowing you to quickly scan and understand the code's structure at a glance.

### Automated `.gitignore` Management

PrismFlow can help keep your Git repositories clean by automatically adding patterns for common untracked files to your `.gitignore`.

#### Manual Trigger

You can manually run the automation at any time:

1.  Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
2.  Search for and select: **PrismFlow: Auto-Add Gitignore Patterns**.
3.  A quick pick menu will appear, allowing you to select which suggested patterns you'd like to add to your `.gitignore` file.

#### Automatic Background Checks

For a truly hands-off experience, PrismFlow can run periodically in the background:

- Based on the `prismflow.gitignore.automationInterval` setting (see [Configuration](#Ô∏è-configuration) below), the extension will automatically scan your repositories for untracked files.
- If it finds untracked files matching your configured `commonPatterns`, it will automatically add them to your `.gitignore` file without requiring user confirmation.
- You will receive a brief information message notification in VS Code letting you know that patterns were automatically added.

### Automated New File Comments

When you create a new file in your workspace, PrismFlow will automatically detect it and insert a basic header comment at the top. This comment includes:

- The appropriate line comment syntax for the detected language (e.g., `//`, `#`, `
