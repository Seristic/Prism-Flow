# PrismFlow

_Navigate Your Code with Clarity and Flow._

---

## ‚ú® Description

**PrismFlow** is an accessibility-focused VS Code extension designed to revolutionize how you understand and navigate your codebase. In the dynamic world of development, code can quickly become complex and daunting. PrismFlow steps in to illuminate your path.

This extension intelligently highlights logical code blocks (like functions, objects, loops, or custom sections) and, crucially, displays concise, contextual information directly in the editor's whitespace. This means you get instant clarity on what a section of code is without needing to scroll or meticulously parse its contents. Experience a more intuitive and inclusive way to explore your code, making complex structures clear and easy to follow.

## üí° Usage

Once activated, PrismFlow automatically analyzes your active editor to identify logical code blocks based on common programming language structures (e.g., `if` statements, `for` loops, function definitions, object literals).

- **Visual Highlights:** You'll see a subtle background highlight applied to these detected blocks.
- **Whitespace Labels:** Next to the opening line of a highlighted block, a small label containing its inferred name or purpose will appear in the margin, allowing you to quickly scan and understand the code's structure at a glance.

> _Further details on customizable behavior and specific language support will be added here as the extension develops._
