# GitWatcher Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: Discord notifications were only sent when using PrismFlow extension commands. External Git pushes (made via Copilot, CLI, or other tools) did not trigger Discord notifications.

**Solution**: Implemented GitWatcher class that monitors the Git repository for external changes and automatically sends Discord notifications.

## Implementation Details

### 1. GitWatcher Class (`src/gitWatcher.ts`)

```typescript
export class GitWatcher {
  // Monitors .git/refs/** and .git/HEAD for changes
  // Automatically detects external commits and sends Discord notifications
  // Includes release tag detection for version notifications
}
```

**Key Features**:
- File system watchers for real-time Git change detection
- 30-second polling as fallback mechanism
- Automatic commit information extraction (hash, message, author)
- Repository URL detection from git remote
- Release tag recognition (v1.2.3 pattern)

### 2. Integration (`src/extension.ts`)

**Activation**:
```typescript
// Initialize Git Watcher for automatic Discord notifications on external Git pushes
gitWatcher = new GitWatcher(context);
gitWatcher.startWatching().then(() => {
  logger.log("GitWatcher initialized and started monitoring Git changes");
}).catch((error) => {
  logger.error("Failed to start GitWatcher: " + error);
});
```

**Deactivation**:
```typescript
// Dispose Git Watcher
if (gitWatcher) {
  gitWatcher.dispose();
  gitWatcher = undefined;
}
```

### 3. Discord Integration

**Automatic Notifications**:
- Calls `discordManager.notifyPush()` for detected commits
- Calls `discordManager.notifyRelease()` for detected version tags
- Only sends notifications if Discord webhooks are configured for the event type

### 4. Testing Command

Added `PrismFlow: Test Git Watcher` command for manual testing and validation.

## File System Monitoring

**Watched Paths**:
- `.git/refs/**` - Detects branch updates, new commits, pushes
- `.git/HEAD` - Detects branch switches, merges, checkouts

**Fallback Mechanism**:
- 30-second interval polling to catch any missed file system events

## Result

✅ **BEFORE**: Discord notifications only for extension commands
✅ **AFTER**: Discord notifications for ALL Git pushes, regardless of how they're made

## Version Information

- **Version**: 1.2.9
- **Release Date**: July 4, 2025
- **Type**: Major Feature Enhancement

## Files Modified

1. `src/gitWatcher.ts` - New GitWatcher class implementation
2. `src/extension.ts` - GitWatcher integration and test command
3. `package.json` - Version bump and new command registration
4. `README.md` - Documentation updates
5. `CHANGELOG.md` - Release notes and feature documentation

## Testing

The GitWatcher can be tested by:
1. Running the `PrismFlow: Test Git Watcher` command
2. Making external commits via CLI or Copilot
3. Creating version tags to test release detection
4. Monitoring Discord channels for automatic notifications

This implementation fully resolves the issue where Discord notifications were not sent for Git pushes made outside the extension.
