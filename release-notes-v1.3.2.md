# PrismFlow v1.3.2 Release Notes

**Release Date:** July 5, 2025

## üèóÔ∏è Workspace-Specific Discord Webhooks

This patch release fixes an important oversight in Discord webhook management by making webhooks workspace-specific instead of global.

### üîß What Changed

Previously, Discord webhooks were stored globally across all VS Code workspaces, which meant:

- ‚ùå All projects shared the same Discord webhooks
- ‚ùå Different repositories would send notifications to the same Discord channels
- ‚ùå No isolation between different projects

Now, Discord webhooks are stored per workspace, which means:

- ‚úÖ Each project/repository can have its own Discord webhooks
- ‚úÖ Different repositories can use different Discord channels
- ‚úÖ Better security and organization of webhook configurations
- ‚úÖ No accidental cross-project notifications

### üì¶ Migration Support

For existing users with global webhooks, the extension now provides:

- **Automatic Detection**: Extension detects existing global webhooks during activation
- **User Prompt**: Asks if you want to migrate existing webhooks to the current workspace
- **Flexible Options**: Choose to migrate or start fresh for each workspace
- **Seamless Upgrade**: No disruption to existing functionality

### üöÄ Benefits

1. **Project Isolation**: Each project maintains its own Discord integration
2. **Better Security**: Webhook URLs are isolated per project
3. **Organized Management**: Easier to manage webhooks for different repositories
4. **Flexible Configuration**: Different notification settings per project

### üõ†Ô∏è Migration Process

When you first open a workspace after updating to v1.3.2:

1. **If you have global webhooks**: You'll see a prompt asking if you want to use them for this workspace
2. **Choose "Yes, use them"**: Migrates your existing webhooks to this workspace
3. **Choose "No, start fresh"**: Starts with a clean webhook configuration
4. **Global webhooks are cleared**: Prevents repeated prompts in other workspaces

### üìã What This Means for You

- **New Projects**: Set up Discord webhooks as usual - they'll be workspace-specific
- **Existing Projects**: You'll be prompted to migrate or start fresh when opening each workspace
- **Multiple Projects**: Each can now have different Discord channels and notification settings
- **Team Collaboration**: Better isolation when working on multiple client projects

### üîÑ Backwards Compatibility

This release is fully backwards compatible:

- Existing webhook functionality remains unchanged
- All webhook commands work the same way
- Webhook setup process is identical
- Only the storage location has changed (global ‚Üí workspace)

### üö® Important Notes

- **One-time migration**: The migration prompt appears only once per workspace
- **Manual setup**: If you choose not to migrate, you'll need to set up webhooks again for each workspace
- **Recommended action**: Migrate existing webhooks if they're appropriate for the current project
