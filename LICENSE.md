3.2. **Preservation of Inclusive Content:**
Any and all components, features, explicit references, or other elements within the Software that constitute **Inclusive Content**, as originally designed, included, or intended by the Licensor, **shall not be removed, altered, obscured, diminished, de-emphasized, or otherwise modified in a manner that detracts from their original intent or visibility** in any distributed or modified version of the Software or any Derivative Works. The integrity, visibility, and spirit of such Inclusive Content must be rigorously maintained and preserved in all subsequent Distributions of the Software or Derivative Works. This condition is fundamental to the ethos of this License.
