# PrismFlow Dashboard Testing Guide

## Current Changes Made

1. **REMOVED all highlighting and liked lines buttons from dashboard** - All highlighting and liked lines features are now Command Palette only
2. **Streamlined dashboard to global management commands only** - Only global management commands (Git, Discord, Version, GitHub) are available in the dashboard
3. **Added clear Command Palette instructions** - Dashboard now shows a comprehensive list of all available Command Palette commands with descriptions
4. **Enhanced error handling** and user feedback for remaining dashboard commands
5. **Added dedicated PrismFlow logging** - All debugging information now goes to the PrismFlow Output channel
6. **Simplified dashboard logic** - Removed all complex editor filtering and focus logic that was causing issues

## Problem Solved

**Previous Issue**: Dashboard highlighting commands were unreliable due to:

- Complex editor state management
- Focus issues with unsupported editors (like code-runner-output)
- Infinite loops and "Unsupported language" errors
- Inconsistent behavior based on active editor state

**Solution**: Completely removed highlighting and liked lines actions from the dashboard. Users must now use the Command Palette for these features, which provides:

- Consistent, reliable behavior
- Proper context awareness
- No focus or editor state issues
- Clear user expectations

## How to View PrismFlow Logs

**IMPORTANT**: To debug what's happening when dashboard commands don't work:

1. Open the **Output** panel in VS Code (View → Output or Ctrl+Shift+U)
2. In the Output panel dropdown, select **"PrismFlow"**
3. OR use Command Palette: Ctrl+Shift+P → "PrismFlow: Show Logs"

All PrismFlow debugging information will appear in this dedicated channel, including:

- Command execution flow
- Editor state information
- Configuration details
- Error messages
- Highlighting process steps

## Commands Available Only via Command Palette

- **Apply Highlights** - Apply syntax highlighting to visible editors
- **Clear Highlights** - Clear all syntax highlighting
- **Refresh Liked Lines** - Refresh the liked lines view
- **Like Current Line** - Like the line at cursor position
- **Copy Block Path** - Copy path of code block at cursor
- **Navigate to Block** - Navigate to a specific code block

Access these via Ctrl+Shift+P → "PrismFlow: [Command Name]"

## Commands Available in Dashboard

- ✅ **Auto-Add Gitignore Patterns** - Adds common ignore patterns to .gitignore
- ✅ **Setup Discord Webhook** - Configure Discord integration
- ✅ **Manage Discord Webhooks** - Manage existing Discord webhooks
- ✅ **Update Package Version** - Update the package.json version
- ✅ **Show Current Version** - Display the current package version
- ✅ **Create GitHub Release** - Create a new GitHub release
- ✅ **Setup GitHub Webhook** - Configure GitHub webhook integration
- ✅ **Manage GitHub Webhooks** - Manage existing GitHub webhooks
- ✅ **Simulate GitHub Release** - Test GitHub release functionality
- ✅ **Simulate GitHub Push** - Test GitHub push functionality

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Install the Updated Extension

1. In VS Code, go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
2. Click the "..." menu and select "Install from VSIX..."
3. Select the `prismflow-1.0.0.vsix` file in this directory
4. Reload VS Code if prompted

### Step 2: Open Test Files

1. Open the `test-dashboard.js` file in VS Code
2. Also open `test-highlighting.js` (both files should be visible in tabs)

### Step 3: Open the Dashboard

1. Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
2. Run "PrismFlow: Show Dashboard"
3. The dashboard should open in a new panel/tab

### Step 4: Test Dashboard Management Commands

**IMPORTANT**: Before testing, open the PrismFlow logs:

1. Go to View → Output (or Ctrl+Shift+U)
2. Select "PrismFlow" from the dropdown
3. Keep this window visible during testing to see debug information

#### Test A: Dashboard Management Commands (Should Work Perfectly!)

1. With test files open (test-dashboard.js and test-highlighting.js)
2. Click on the Dashboard tab/panel to focus it
3. **Verify Command Palette instructions are displayed** - The dashboard should show a clear list of available Command Palette commands
4. **Test a management command** - Click any management button (e.g., "Show Current Version")
5. **Check the PrismFlow Output logs** - you should see:

   ```text
   [Time] Dashboard executing command: prismflow.showCurrentVersion
   [Time] Executing command: prismflow.showCurrentVersion
   ```

6. **Expected behavior**:
   - Command executes successfully
   - Success message appears in the dashboard
   - No editor focus or highlight-related errors
   - Logs show simple, clean command execution

#### Test B: Command Palette Highlighting

1. Click on the `test-dashboard.js` editor tab to focus it
2. Use Ctrl+Shift+P and run "PrismFlow: Apply Highlights"
3. **Expected behavior**: Highlights should be applied to the focused editor
4. Use Ctrl+Shift+P and run "PrismFlow: Clear Highlights"
5. **Expected behavior**: Highlights should be cleared

### Step 5: Test Command Palette Commands

1. Click on the `test-dashboard.js` editor tab to focus it
2. Position cursor inside a code block (like inside the `if` statement)
3. Use Ctrl+Shift+P and run "PrismFlow: Copy Block Path"
4. **Expected behavior**: Block path should be copied to clipboard

## Expected Results

- ✅ Dashboard shows **only management commands** - no highlighting or liked lines buttons
- ✅ Dashboard displays **clear Command Palette instructions** for highlighting/liked lines features
- ✅ All dashboard management commands work reliably regardless of editor focus
- ✅ No "No active editor" errors or editor focus issues
- ✅ Command Palette commands still work when invoked directly
- ✅ Clean, simple dashboard interface focused on global management

## Summary

This final approach completely solves the original problem by:

1. **Removing ALL problematic highlighting/liked lines commands** from the dashboard
2. **Keeping ONLY reliable global management commands** in the dashboard (Git, Discord, Version, GitHub)
3. **Providing clear, comprehensive guidance** to users about Command Palette usage
4. **Eliminating ALL editor state management complexity** from the dashboard
5. **Maintaining full functionality** - all commands are still available, just in the appropriate context (Command Palette)

The dashboard is now a **simple, reliable management interface** that focuses on global commands, while all editor-specific functionality is handled through the Command Palette where it belongs. This provides a much cleaner, more predictable user experience.
