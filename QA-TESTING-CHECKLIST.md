# PrismFlow QA Testing Checklist

## üö® MANDATORY PRE-RELEASE TESTING

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER RELEASE WITHOUT COMPLETING THIS CHECKLIST**

- [ ] Run `pnpm install` - Extension does NOT interfere
- [ ] Package files are NOT opened automatically
- [ ] Package files are NOT modified automatically
- [ ] NO file flooding during package operations
- [ ] NO forced save prompts during package operations

### Workspace Operations
- [ ] Opening workspace folders works normally
- [ ] Switching between workspaces works normally
